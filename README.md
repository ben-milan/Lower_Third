# This is Lower-Third:

  ### How does it work:
  Run the python File `main.py`
  
  - Enter a number of players between 2 and 6
  - The game will prompt you to decide whether to take your chance with a random number (1-100) determining if you're in the upper two-thirds (above 33) or in the Lower Third.
  - If you are in the upper two-thirds, your points get accumulated (which are the created number), and you can decide whether you're taking your chance again.
  - However, if you end up in the Lower Third, you lose all your points for that round, and the next player takes their turn.
  - First to 500 Points wins.
  - So yeah. That's basically it. Have fun and don't get in the Lower-Third.
